# Swiftcord
A Discord API package in Swift

Hi! This is a community projecvts from the [Swift Den](https://discord.gg/DzpaehyZyv)

Firstly we need to get a basic client and login system, then work on strctures and expanding coverage of the API, firstly in messages and message content (for ping/pong testing) then slash commands to allow for basic bots that do data processing.

Todo:
[] Package initialization.
[] Client login
[] Basic stuctures
[] Interactions
